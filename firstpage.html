HTML, an initialism of HyperText Markup Language, is the predominant markup language for Web pages. It provides a means to describe the structure of text-based information in a document - by denoting certain text as links, headings, paragraphs, lists, and so on - and to supplement that text with interactive forms, embedded images, and other objects. HTML is written in the form of tags, surrounded by angle brackets. HTML can also describe, to some degree, the appearance and semantics of a document, and can include embedded scripting language code (such as JavaScript) which can affect the behavior of Web browsers and other HTML processors."HTML" (2008, December 3).

When the file is saved with a 'html' extension, Visual Studio Code will realize you're working on a HTML file. In the bottom-right hand side of the status bar, VSC will display 'HTML'. (You can click this to change the filetype that VSC uses). Previewing the file (control+shift+V on Windows, command+shift+V in Mac) will display the file rendered as HTML. Alternatively, you can also save the file, then open it in a web browser. (Depending on how your computer is configured, you should be able to do this by at least one of three methods:
•	Double-clicking on the file.
•	Dragging the file into a browser window.
•	Going to the "File" menu in your browser and selecting "Open File".
It should display in the browser.)
Unfortunately, without HTML it will only display as a single paragraph.
